# comp4431-posterization-with-dithering

In this project, we apply Error-diffusion dithering algorithm to Posterization in the image lab, inspired by "Optimal Parallel Error-Diffusion Dithering" by Panagiotis T. Metaxas. The purpose of this extension to the lab is to explore various diffusion matrix parameters and explore the potential of parallel calculation mechanisms in dithering, as mentioned in the paper.

The primary objective of the project is to examine how different matrix configurations affect both the visual quality and computational time of the error diffusion dithering process.

## Functionalities
- Add Error Diffusion Dithering into the Shade Layer
- A selection box for choosing different diffusion matrices
- A toggle switch to turn the parallel mechanism on/off
- A Textbox for displaying the time consumed during the calculation
- A canvas for showing the processed image result
- Ensuring that the canvas correctly processes the image based on the settings
- Ability to utilize Error Diffusion Dithering on an input image to generate a black-and-white outcome.
- Ability to apply Error Diffusion Dithering to achieve a posterization effect on an input image.
